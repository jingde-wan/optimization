    "As part of its weekly production, a paint company produces five batches of paints, always the same, for some big clients who have a stable demand.  Every paint batch is produced in a single production process, all in the same blender that needs to be cleaned between each batch.  The durations of blending paint batches 1 to 5 are 40, 35, 45, 32 and 50 minutes respectively.  The cleaning times depend of the colors and the paint types.  For example, a long cleaning period is required if an oil-based paint is produced after a water-based paint, or to produce white paint after a dark color.  The times are given in minutes in the following matrix $A$ where $A_{ij}$ denotes the cleaning time after batch $i$ if it is followed by batch $j$.\n",
